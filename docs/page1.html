<h1>Blockly as a programming (and programming teaching) tool</h1>
<p>One of the first things that brought me to programming was Logo back in the mid 1980's. It wasnt the structure of
  the programs that you could type stuff that would make things happen on the screen. To me the magic was that you
  could share and that typing the same things would always produce the same results so you could iterate and do even
  crazier things with your designs.</p>
<p>If running the following commands:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">repeat</span> <span class="hljs-number">4</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">forward</span> <span class="hljs-number">90</span>
</code></pre>
<p>would create a square what would happen if we started moving the turtle around without drawing anything and then run
  our square command? How would we write circles? Triangles? Other geometrical shapes?</p>
<p>This has always motivated my interest in computers, the web, and odball projects that will make something
  interesting but not necessarily useful. It's curiosity, the desire to know how to do something even if there are
  better ways to do it.</p>
<p>Move forward about 30 years and I found <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> and I found myself thinking
  back to Logo and my experiences with old computers at school.</p>
<p>But it looks different and it uses a different paradigm to create the scripts that will make things happen. Figure 1
  shows an animated example created with Scratch and Figure 2 shows a more technically complex example using the same
  language.</p>

<p>That's where I think Scratch and similar tools can be useful. Google released a set of coding tutorials using Wonder
  Woman and <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly</a>, a Scratch-like application to make teaching
  computer science concepts easier for children.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows an example of what one of the <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/projects/wonderwoman">Wonder
    Woman based tutorials</a> look like: you assemble the tasks for Wonder woman using blocks and then play the actions
  represented by the blocks we've assembled together.</p>

<p>How can we leverage these tools for a larger audience? How can we make a programming environment that gives us both
  the advantage of Blockly/Scratch and allows us to copy and paste the resulting code in one of many programming
  languages.</p>
<p>Blockly has several advantages: it allows you to see the results of your block actions in the target language of
  your choice. The currently supported languages are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Dart</li>
  <li>PHP</li>
  <li>Lua</li>
  <li>Python</li>
</ul>
<p>In the configuration we can create groups of blocks to show users.</p>
<p>We can configure Blockly to show only a few block or the entire set.</p>
<p>We can also create custom blocks that better fit the language we want to teach or the session's objectives.</p>
<p>It can be configured to run on Google's App Engine. This will create a community where scripts will be automatically
  saved and shared with the community.</p>
<p>Let's build a Blockly app.</p>
<h2>Building Basics</h2>
<p>Download the code or clone the Git repository from:</p>
<pre><code>https:<span class="hljs-regexp">//gi</span>thub.com<span class="hljs-regexp">/google/</span>blockly
</code></pre>
<p>If you downloaded a compressed version of the files expand them and get them ready. We'll come back to them to build
  the directory structure for o ur application.</p>
<p>Blockly is built with Javascript, Node/NPM and Google's Closure Compiler. I will not cover how to build the app...
  You can rebuild the scripts on your own if interested.</p>
<p>We'll start with the most basic Blockly app. It is a simple HTML page where we insert a series of elements to make
  Blockly work.</p>
<p>The first part is to add Blockly an associated scripts for the page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blockly itself</li>
  <li>A basic set of blocks</li>
  <li>The Javascript syntax file</li>
  <li>English translation of Blockly's messages</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-language-markup"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"js/blockly_compressed.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"js/blocks_compressed.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"js/javascript_compressed.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"msg/js/en.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined"></span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We then set up two empty elements: A div that will hold the blocks and the work area, and a text are that will hold
  the Javascript version of the block code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-language-markup">&lt;div <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"blocklyDiv"</span>
      <span class="hljs-attribute">style</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"height: 600px; width: 800px;"</span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;textarea <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"textarea"</span>
          <span class="hljs-attribute">style</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"width: 800px; height: 300px"</span>&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The next postion is an <code>xml</code> element that will hold the block elements that we want to use in our
  application.</p>
<pre><code class="language-language-markup">&lt;xml id=<span class="hljs-string">"toolbox"</span>
      style=<span class="hljs-string">"display: none"</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"controls_if"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"controls_repeat_ext"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"logic_compare"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"math_number"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"math_arithmetic"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text_print"</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="hljs-keyword">block</span>&gt;
&lt;/xml&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The final portion is the script that will make everything work. This is also broken in three sections.</p>
<p>The first part injects Blockly with the toolbox we defined earlier.</p>
<p>The next function defines how Blockly will update the text area with the result of coverting the blocks into
  Javascript.</p>
<p>Finally we add a change listener and tell it to run <code>myUpdateFunction</code> every time it's triggered.</p>
<pre><code class="language-language-markup"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> workspace = Blockly.inject(<span class="hljs-string">'blocklyDiv'</span>,
{<span class="hljs-attr">toolbox</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">'toolbox'</span>)});

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">myUpdateFunction</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> code = Blockly.JavaScript.workspaceToCode(workspace);
  <span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">'textarea'</span>).value = code;
}
workspace.addChangeListener(myUpdateFunction);
</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. We have a Blockly application that will convert the blocks into Javascript. However it won't save the
  code and provides no way of sharing it. We'll tackle that challenge next.</p>
<h2>Adding a backend server</h2>
<p>Blockly comes pre-configured to work with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> (it's
  a Google product, after all). For this section I will assume that you have some experience in configuring and
  installing applications in App Engine; if not I would recommend you find a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/quickstart">good
    tutorial</a> and go through it before continuing.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads">Python SDK</a></li>
  <li>Log into <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a> and create an application.</li>
  <li>Edit <code>appengine/app.yaml</code> and change the application ID from blockly-demo to the application name you
    created in the previous step.</li>
  <li>Copy (or soft-link) the following files and directories into appengine/static/:
    <ul>
      <li>demos/</li>
      <li>msg/</li>
      <li>media/</li>
      <li>*_compressed.js</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run the Google App Engine Launcher from the GUI, add your appengine directory as an existing application, and
    press the &quot;Deploy&quot; button. If you prefer to use the command line, run: <code>appcfg.py --oauth2 update
      appengine/</code></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Optional</strong>: If you'd like to use <code>blockly_uncompressed.js</code> on the server, also copy that
  file into <code>appengine/static/</code>, copy core into appengine/static/, and copy closure-library/ into the parent
  directory, appengine/.</p>
<p><strong>Optional</strong>: If you'd like to run the Blockly Playground, you'll have to copy the blocks, generators,
  and tests directories, as well as the files in the prior optional step.</p>
<p>Note that the Google App Engine Launcher has been deprecated and a replacement has not been implemented or made
  official. That said I could get away with using an older version of the App Engine Launcher and deploy the
  application.</p>
<p>You can find it at <a href="https://blockly-demo-171420.appspot.com/">https://blockly-demo-171420.appspot.com/</a></p>
<p>The demos will show you the capabilities of Blockly beyond what we've discussed so far. Now that we have the tools
  we can talk a little bit about philosophy.</p>
<h2>Why use Blockly?</h2>
<p>When we start looking at Blockly one of the first things to consider is who is our target audience. I'll apply an
  ADDIE model to suggest ideas about how to use Blockly in an educational environment.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p>
<p>We're building an application that will make it easier to learn programming.</p>
<p>These Blocky applications can be targeted towards younger users who are learning to program and interact with code
  for the first time and also for older users who have not had formal programming experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong>:</p>
<p>Depending on how we want to structure the learning experiences we can either create individual Blockly pages like
  the Made with Code <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/projects/wonderwoman">Wonder Woman's Examples</a> where you
  limit the number of blocks you can use and also the type of blocks a given page has access to.</p>
<p>For older users or those children who have mastered the more limited concepts we can also provide a larger set of
  blocks to experiment with.</p>
<p>Finally, if we're working with frameworks we can generate custom blocks that will do specific tasks. For example, if
  we're using Blockly to teach web components concepts we can create blocks that will translate to class-based custom
  elements.</p>
<p><strong>Development</strong>:</p>
<p>Before we modify any of the blocks and create pages we need to know what the breakdown for the pages is: what blocks
  are they using and what is our objective for that particular page.</p>
<p>Once we do we can take some of pages on the demo site and modify them to match our goals. We can also theme the
  pages to a common look and feel.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong>:</p>
<p>Implementing the pages is easy. We can start from scratch or we can clone an existing demo page that has the
  features we need and modify it to suit.</p>
<p>At the server level we must make sure to change the version of the application in the <code>app.yaml</code>
  configuration file. This will allow us to deploy multiple versions of the blocks and pages to App Engine without
  loosing the ability to rollback if there is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong>:</p>
<p>I think evaluation of Blockly projects is mostly outcomes based. Did they participant's learn? Did they enjoy
  themselves in the process? Can they translate the content they learned into other areas and domains?</p>
