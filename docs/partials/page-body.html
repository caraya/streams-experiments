      <p>I've been really excited about recent developments in web layout. I've finally decided to get my act together and start building layouts using these new tools. I don't know how many of these layouts will make it to a production site but
      it's always fun to play with them.</p>

        <dd>The idea is that we can take the values and plug them in to our production stylesheets as a starting point for further experiments.</dd>

          Using a demo from <a href="https://codersblock.com/">Will Boyd</a>I built a mock of a Wikipedia page using his <a href="https://github.com/lonekorean/hello-houdini/tree/master/demos/placeholder-box-props">placeholder boxes</a> to mock the
          placement of the images.
        </dd>
        <dd>Yes, I know I could use SVG to do so and it may be a good idea when working with Service Workers to provide a good offline fallback but this way I can play with the dimensions of the place holder and see how it looks at different
        dimensions before deciding on the final image.</dd>

        <dd>I need to do more research to see what looks normal for Japanese readers using vertical layouts as opposed to the rtl horizontal layout that I've seen the most.</dd>

        make that much of a difference since the service worker caches the fonts but for larger projects or those that don't use service workers it's an important consideration.</dd>

      <p>CSS Paged Media provides extensions to CSS 2 and CSS 3 modules that will allow them to work in generating high quality printed PDF or good masters for printers to work with. The best example I've seen is Lea Verou's <a href=
